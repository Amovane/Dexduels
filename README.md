# README

Arbitrage program demo using web3js lib to implement interaction with dex which is running on smartbch chain like `Benswap`, `Mistswap`, etc. By the way, it can also run on other EVM compatible sidechain after a few modifications.

## Notice

The demo was made only in order to share the arbitrage model, please must be careful to run it on production enviroment. There are some problems still need you to resolve like consensus problem.

## Strategy summary

According to `DEXDUELS_DEXES`, the program would generate pairs of dexes to make some arbitrage attempts and according to different pairs of input token and output token which was generated by `BASE_SYMBOL` and `QUOTE_SYMBOLS`, each pair of dexes would make some profitable swaps with the pair of tokens.

## Usage

- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Fill properties in `.env.template` file like below and rename it to `.env`
  ```
  SMART_BCH_WSS=wss://smartbch-wss.greyh.at
  SMART_BCH_HTTPS=https://global.uat.cash
  QUOTE_SYMBOLS=EBEN,FLEX         // quotes for the arbitrage
  BASE_SYMBOL=WBCH                // base for the arbitrage
  BASE_QTY=1                      // amount of base for the arbitrage
  INTERVAL=5000                   // interval for check the opportunities
  TRIGGER_PROFIT_IN_USD=4         // profit for trigger the arbitrage
  HTTP_PROXY=                     // setting proxy if your machine has configured
  DEXDUELS_DEXES=Benswap,Mistswap // name of dex which would participate in the arbitrage
  WALLET_ADDRESS=<YOUR WALLET ADDRESS>
  WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE KEY OF WALLET>
  ```
- Run with `node dexduels.js`
